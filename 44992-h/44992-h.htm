<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="family" id="family">THE FAMILY THAT GOES ABROAD
BECAUSE IT'S THE THING TO DO.</a></p>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">That</span> men and women should leave their homes at
the end of summer and go somewhere,&mdash;though it
be only to Margate,&mdash;has become a thing so fixed
that incomes the most limited are made to stretch
themselves to fit the rule, and habits the most
domestic allow themselves to be interrupted and
set at naught. That we gain much in health
there can be no doubt. Our ancestors, with their
wives and children, could do without their autumn
tour; but our ancestors did not work so hard as
we work. And we gain much also in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knowledge, though such knowledge is for the
most part superficial, and our mode of acquiring
it too often absurd. But the English world is
the better for the practice. "Home-staying
youths have ever homely wits," and we may
fairly suppose that our youths are less homely
in this particular after they have been a day or
two in Paris, and a week or two in Switzerland,
and up and down the Rhine, than they would have
been had they remained in their London lodgings
through that month of September,&mdash;so weary to
those who are still unable to fly away during that
most rural of months.</p>

<p>Upon the whole we are proud of our travelling;
but yet we must own that, as a nation of travellers,
we have much to learn; and it always seems that
the travelling English family which goes abroad
because it's the thing to do, with no clearly defined
object as to the pleasure to be obtained or the
delights to be expected,&mdash;with hardly a defined
idea of the place to be visited, has, as a class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
more to learn than any other class of tourists.</p>

<p>In such family arrangements daughters of course
predominate. Sons can travel alone or with their
own friends. This arrangement they generally
prefer, and for it they are always able to give
substantial reasons, in which their mammas may,
or may not, put implicit confidence. Daughters
can travel alone too occasionally, as I hope to
be able to show by-and-by in a sketch of that
much abused but invaluable English lady, the
Unprotected Female Tourist. But such feminine
independence is an exception to the rule, and
daughters are generally willing to submit themselves
to that paternal and maternal guidance from
which the adult male tourist so stoutly revolts.
Paterfamilias of course is there, paying the bills,
strapping up the cloaks, scolding the waiters,
obeying, but not placidly obeying, the female
behests to which he is subject, and too frequently
fretting uncomfortably beneath the burden of the
day, the heat and the dust, the absence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
slippers, and the gross weight of his too-matured
proportions. And he has, too, other inward grievances
of which he can say nothing to any ear.
Something of the salt of youth is left to him,&mdash;something
of the spirit, though but little of
the muscle,&mdash;and he thinks of his boys who are
far afield, curtailed in their exploits by no petticoats,
abridged by no stiff proprieties; and he
wishes that he was with them, feeling that his
trammels are heavy. The mother, of course, is
there, kind to all her party, but too often stiff
and hard to all beyond it, anxious that papa should
have his comforts, anxious that her girls should
see everything, but afraid to let them see too much,
sometimes a little cross when the work becomes
too hard or the pace of the pony is too rough,
somewhat dowdy in her cotton dress, and ill-suited
to the hat which she wears. She possesses
every virtue under the sun. Of human beings she
is the least selfish. Her heart is full of love,
and all who know her dote upon her. At home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
she is charming, at home she is graceful and
sweet to be seen. But on her travels things do
not go easily with her, and her temper will
sometimes become ruffled. The daughters are
determined to do the thing well, to see everything,
to be stopped by no English prejudices,
to be at their ease, or at any rate look as though
they were; to talk French boldly in spite of their
little slips; to wear their dresses jauntily, and
make the best of themselves; to have all their
eyes open, and carry home with them something
from every day's work. Who will say that they
are wrong? Nay, who will not declare that they
are right in all this? But they overdo the thing
in their intense desire to utilize every moment;
they are, alas, sometimes a little ashamed of papa
and mamma; and as they return down the Rhine,
having begun in Switzerland, and done Baden
Baden, Frankfort, and Homburg on their way,
their dresses are not quite so jaunty, nor their
gloves so neat, nor their hats in such perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
trim, as when those articles were inspected on
the evening before they left home. That resolve
to make the best of themselves has been somewhat
forgotten during the stern realities of their journeys.
A French girl will remember her crinoline and her
ribbons throughout every moment of her long day's
work,&mdash;will think of them through it all, preserving
herself that she may preserve them, if
they were worth a thought at the beginning. If
she is minded to end dowdily, she will begin
dowdily. But the trouble of such continued care
is too much for an English girl. She lapses first
into indifference, and from indifference to aversion;
till at last she takes an absolute pride in the
absence of those little prettinesses which she
had at first been determined to maintain so
stoutly. Who has not seen her at the Dover
railway station on her return home, as she stands
there grasping with one hand an Alpine stock and
an umbrella, while she leans listlessly on the other,
regardless of the torn extremities of her gloves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the battered form of her hat?</p>

<p>Such is the family that goes abroad because it is
the thing to do. The spirit that instigates them
to roam afield is no hankering after fashion. The
father and mother, and daughters also, of the family
of which I speak, are well aware that such tourings
are too common to confer fashion or distinction.
The days in which we heard that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mrs. Grill is very ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And nothing will improve her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless she sees the Tuileries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And waddles down the Louvre,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are well nigh over, and are certainly over for such
sensible people as I am describing. It is not
fashion that they seek, nor is it chiefly amusement.
Paterfamilias, when he starts, knows that
he will not be amused, and already wishes that
the journey was over, and that he could be back
at his club. Mamma dreads it somewhat, and
has more of misgiving than of pleasant anticipation.
She has not much of happiness when
papa is cross, and he is usually cross when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is uncomfortable. And then the people at the
inns are so often uncivil; and she fears the beds!
And the girls look for no unalloyed satisfaction.
They know that they have hard work before them,
and the dread of those slips in their French is not
pleasant to them. But it is the thing to do. Not
to have seen Florence, Rome, Munich, and Dresden,
not to be at home as regards the Rhine, not
to have ridden over the Gemmi or to have talked
to Alpine climbers at Zermatt, is to be behind the
world. And then there is so much to be done in
Europe! Ars longa, vita brevis. Last year papa
wouldn't move,&mdash;that is, he wouldn't move beyond
Cromer. Carry is, alas! twenty-nine; Fanny is
twenty-seven; even Sophie,&mdash;the childish Sophie,&mdash;is
twenty-four. Under such circumstances, who
can dare to think of ease, or even of pleasure?
Years are flowing by, and the realities of life,&mdash;still
doubtful realities, but with so much of pain
in the doubt!&mdash;are coming on. Who can say
how soon the income arising from paternal energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
may be at an end, and that the modest means of
pensioned age may render all such work impracticable?
It is imperative that the places be seen,
that the lions be killed and ticked off as difficulties
done with and overcome. What may be the exact
balance of advantage to any of them when the tour
is over, neither Carry nor Fanny stops to inquire;
but they put their heads together and determine
that the thing must be arranged. They feel that
they are right. "It is education," says Fanny,
with her eyes glittering. "Home-staying youths
have ever homely wits," says Sophie, thinking
perhaps too much of her own advantage in point
of years. "I will talk to papa in earnest," says
Carry, with resolute mildness. She does talk to
papa in earnest, conscious that she is thereby
doing her duty; and thus the family goes abroad,
because it is the thing to do.</p>

<p>In the old days,&mdash;days, let us say, that are now
some hundred and fifty years old,&mdash;young Englishmen
used to travel for their education; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
entered into the minds of those who sent them
that they should see something of the society of
the countries which they visited. And in such
travelling time was given for such intercourse.
But with the ordinary English tourist, and especially
with the ordinary English tourist family,
there is no such attempt now, no hope of any such
good fortune. Carry and Fanny mean to talk
French boldly, but they intend to do so in railway
carriages, at hotel dinners, and to the guides
and waiters. No preparation is made for any
attempt at social intercourse. Letters of introduction
are not obtained, nor is there time allowed
for any sojourn which would make an entrance into
society possible. That does not come even into
Fanny's programme, though Fanny is enthusiastic.
Scenery, pictures, architecture, and a limited but
minute geographical inquiry, are the points to
which it is intended that attention shall be given.
And of these much is learned. A true love of
scenery is common to almost all who will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the trouble to seek it. I think that it is, at any
rate, common to all English men and women. Of
pictures the knowledge acquired is most frequently
what may be called dead knowledge. Carry soon
learns to know a Rubens from a Raphael, and
almost learns to know a Titian from a Tintoretto.
She stores her memory with facts as to individual
pictures, remembers dates, and can tell
you who was the teacher of whom. She is sometimes
a little restless and mildly impatient during
her labours in the galleries, and rejoices often
when the hard day's work is done and the custodian
bids her depart. But her toils have not
been barren, and she enjoys after a fashion what
she has learned. Architecture comes easier, as
the time given to it is necessarily less, and the
attention may be more vaguely applied. But, on
that account, less is carried away, and the memories
of the cathedral have dwindled to nothing,
while the positions of the world-famous pictures
are still remembered. As to the geography, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
comes unsought, and remains unappreciated; but
it is not on that account the less valuable. How
few of our young ladies can define the position of
Warsaw; while so many know accurately that of
Wiesbaden!</p>

<p>Many accusations have been made against travelling
English families, touching that peculiarity of
theirs in going hither and thither without an
attempt to see and know the people of the
countries they visit; and it is alleged, and truly
alleged, that Frenchmen and Germans coming
here do make efforts to come among us and see
us, and learn of what like we are. But I think
that we can defend ourselves on that score. We
travel among Frenchmen and Germans in bulk,
while they come among us by twos and threes.
Our twos and our threes see as much of them as
they see of us. With them families do not go
abroad because it is the thing to do. How many
an Englishman stays in Paris two days to see the
city; whereas no Frenchman comes to London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for such a flying visit, unless he be a <i>commis
voyageur</i>, or has some business in hand.</p>

<p>The family that travels because it is the thing
to do, is, I am sure, in the right. Fanny understood
her point when she said that it was education.
It is education; but if one can judge from
the faces, voices, and manners of the persons
undergoing it, it is not often pleasure. The work
has been too hard, the toil too unremitting, the
endeavour to make the most of the short six weeks
too unrelenting, to allow of much of the softness
of summer enjoyment. The stern Fanny, who, as
she has gone on her way, has made the foreign
Bradshaw all her own, has allowed no rest to her
weary father, no ease to her over-driven mother.
"If we don't do Munich now, we shall never do
it," she has said with energy. And thus the
sullen father and the despairing mother have been
dragged along further dusty railroads, to another
hot city of pictures, in which Paterfamilias found
nothing to comfort him but the beer, and mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
no alleviation but the excessive punctuality and
neatness of the washerwoman.</p>

<p>But, at last, they are at home,&mdash;the penance is
over, and the true pleasure begins. They have
done the work and have garnered the wages.
Papa is sufficiently happy in feeling that he cannot
be again taken away from his dressing-room
and cellar, at any rate, for ten months; and
mamma, as she once more creeps into her own
bed, thanks God that she has been enabled to
go through her duty. Carry and Fanny hide their
travelling gear with some little feeling of shame,
and, as they toil at their journals for the first week
of their return, take pride in thinking that they
have seen at any rate as much as their neighbours.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="man" id="man">THE MAN WHO TRAVELS ALONE.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
Men</span> who travel alone may be divided into two
classes. There is the man who cannot get a
companion, and the man who does not want one.
There is also, between these two solitary men, an
intermediate solitary man, who travels alone
because he cannot find the companion that would
exactly suit him. But, whatever may be the cause
of his solitude, the man who travels alone is not,
I think, to be envied.</p>

<p>If he be a studious, thoughtful man, taking
delight in museums and houses of assembly,
given to chemistry and the variations of European
politics, fond of statistics and well-instructed in
stuffed vermin, he may be as happy travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
alone as he would be alone in his library; but
such a man is exceptional, and I am not now
speaking of him. He is a student and not a
tourist. He is going to school and not out for
a holiday. The man who travels alone, with
whom we have to do, is one who goes abroad for
a little health, for a good deal of recreation if he
can find it, and for the pleasure of looking about
him and seeing the world. The improvement in
health he may find; but the recreation will be
doubtful, unless he be one by nature averse to
gregarious habits.</p>

<p>When we see such a one,&mdash;and such a one is
often seen straying along the Rhine or wandering
listlessly among the mountains,&mdash;we always suppose
him to be alone because he cannot help it.
We are never kind enough to give him credit for a
choice for solitude; and we avoid him sedulously
because we have it in our power to give him that
one thing that he wants. Such is the human nature
of tourists, which in this respect is very like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the human nature of people who stay at home.
We like to have at our houses those whom it is
difficult to obtain, and do not care to entertain
those who are always ready to come to us.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the ill-nature of tourist
parties in this respect is justified to a great
degree by the experienced results of any exceptional
good-nature into which soft-hearted persons
may be occasionally betrayed. Who among us
that has been thus soft-hearted on an occasion has
not repented in sackcloth and ashes? The solitary
tourist when once taken up can hardly be dropped;
he appears, and reappears, and comes up again till
the original friends of the original good-natured
sinner become gloomy and sullen and talk of
strong measures. Whispers of an enforced separation
are murmured about, and Jones, who has
picked the man up, and who "found that there
was something in him" as they sat next each
other in a railway carriage, is made to understand
by Smith and Walker, that unless he can contrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to drop Mr. Robinson, he must be dropped himself.
It is not so easy to drop Mr. Robinson.
The paths of Switzerland, and the roads into Italy,
are open to all the world.</p>

<p>Poor Robinson! we will cling to him for a while,
and endeavour to show the nature of the misery
which he suffers. At home he is an honest fellow,
and those who know him best say that he is a
gentleman. He is quite equal to the men whom
he meets on his tour, and who look down upon
him because of his solitude. The time will probably
come when he will be no longer alone, when
he will have a wife and children, and a house into
which Jones would think it a blessing to be
admitted.</p>

<p>But at present Robinson is alone, and has
known himself to be thrown aside by the men
whose society he coveted. He had come out on
his tour with much compunction, dreading his
solitude, believing in his heart of hearts that it
would be better for him to go with his sisters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Broadstairs. But he had accused himself of being
unmanly, he had buckled on his armour in the
shape of a Murray's guide, a vocabulary, and a
Bradshaw, and had started by the Ostend boat,
assuring himself that many others had done the
same before him, and had returned home proudly
to tell the tale of their wanderings. On the railway
to Cologne he had picked up with Jones, and
for twenty-four hours the prospects of a blessed
union had cheered him. He had followed the
friends to their hotel with some half-word of
excuse. He had sat by Smith at the first dinner,
dividing Smith from a pretty young countrywoman,
and had found Smith to be somewhat unpleasant.
Had he understood his game he would have taken
himself to the other side of Smith. Wanting to
gain much, he should have surrendered something.
In the evening he had smoked with Jones, whose
good-nature had not as yet been outraged. Then
had Walker and Smith roundly brought their
friend to task, and Jones having asked the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fellow which way he meant to travel on the
morrow, had plainly told him that he and his
party intended to take another route.</p>

<p>Some chance reader of these words may, perhaps,
one day have felt such rebuke, and be able to
understand its harshness. "Ah, yes! very well,"
said Robinson. "Then I dare say we shall not
meet again. I couldn't very well alter my plan
now." There was a dash of manliness about him,
and he could show some gallantry before the traitor
friend who had become his foe. But when he
went up to his room, the tears were almost in his
eyes, and as he turned into bed, he resolved that
on the morrow he would betake himself home.</p>

<p>But on the morrow his heart was higher, and he
persevered. He saw the three odious men as they
started from the inn door, and was able to perceive
that they were not gentlemen. Smith he thought
he had seen behind a counter. As for Walker, he
had caught Walker tripping with his <i>h</i>s, and was
glad to be rid of him. Before his breakfast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
over he had taught himself almost to believe that
he had dropped the equivocal party, and had told
himself that he should be very careful how he selected
his acquaintance.</p>

<p>But not the less was he very melancholy, and at
the end of the second day from that morning had
fallen into a dreary state of misanthropy. Ideas
had begun to float through his brain which he believed
to be philosophical, but which all tended to
the no-good-in-anything school of thought. He
had assumed a constrained look of contempt, and
would hardly notice the waiter, as he declined one
after another the dishes brought to him at dinner.
In the evening he roamed about moodily in the
twilight, asking himself psychological questions
about suicide; not, indeed, intending to kill himself,
but having a fancy for the subject as one of
great interest. He thought that he might, perhaps,
have killed himself had he not felt that his
doing so would be deleterious to his sisters. As
for Jones, or Smith, or Walker, in his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
mood he would not have spoken to them. He was
in love with solitude, and would have been severe
to any Jones or any Walker who might have
intruded upon him.</p>

<p>But on the next day he makes another effort,
having encountered our friend Paterfamilias, with
his wife and three daughters, upon a Rhine steamboat.
Like a prudent young man in such circumstances,
he first speaks a word to the father, and
the father admits the word graciously. Fathers so
situated are always oblivious of their daughters,
and never remember that they, when young men,
used to make similar attempts. But mothers
never forget, and with accurate measures of mental
yard and foot, take inventory of all comers, weighing
every gesture, and knowing the value of every
stitch in the man's garment, and of every tone in
the man's voice. The stitches and tones belonging
to Robinson were not much in his favour. When
a man is at discount with himself he is usually
below par with all the world beside. When in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
course of a couple of hours Robinson had remarked
to Sophie,&mdash;the youthful Sophie,&mdash;that the Rhine
was the monarch of rivers, the mother speaks a
cautious word to Carry, the eldest daughter, and
just as misanthropy was giving place to a genial
love for all his kind under a pleasant smile on
Sophie's mouth, the whole family whisk themselves
away, and our friend is again alone.</p>

<p>He has Childe Harold in his pocket, and the labour
of learning a stanza or two by heart carries
him on into Switzerland. In ascending the Rigi
he again comes across Jones and Walker. Alas
for human nature, he is only too happy to be recognized
by those whom he had assured himself that
he despised! A civil word half spoken by a
panting voice, a nod of recognition which could
hardly not have been given, draws him once more
into their social circle, and he forgets the counter,
and the doubtful <i>h</i>s, and the bearishness of the obdurate
Smith. If they will only open their arms
to him, and let him be one of them! A fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
comes upon him that they may suspect him to be
impecunious, and he adapts his conversation to the
idea, striving to make it apparent, by words carefully
turned for the purpose, that he is quite
another sort of person than that. Walker sees the
attempt, and measures the man accordingly,&mdash;but
measures him wrongly. Poor Robinson has been
mean,&mdash;is mean; he has sunk beneath the weight
of his solitude to a lowness that is not natural to
him; but he has not the meanness of which they
suspect him. "If you let that man hang on to
you any longer, he'll be borrowing money of you,"
says Smith. Jones remarks that it takes two men
to play at that game; but on the following morning
the three friends, having necessarily been
domiciled with Robinson on the top of the mountain
that night, are careful to descend without him,
and the poor wretch knows that he has again been
dropped. The trio, as they descend the hill, are
very merry withal respecting the Robinson difficulty,
indulging that joy of ascendancy which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
naturally belongs to us when we have discovered
anyone low enough to require our assistance.</p>

<p>Along the lakes and over the mountains goes
the wretched man, still in solitude. He tells himself
in moments of sober earnest that he has made
a mistake, and has subjected himself to great
misery in attempting to obtain alone delights
which by their very nature require companionship.
Robinson is not a student. He cares nothing for
minerals, and knows nothing of botany. Neither
the social manners of the people among whom he
is wandering, nor the formation of the earth's crust
in those parts, are able to give him that excitement
which he requires. The verdure of the Alps, the
peaks of the mountains, the sun rising through
the mists, would give him pleasure if he had with
him another soul to whom he could exclaim in the
loving intimacy of free intercourse, "By George,
Tom, that is jolly! It's all very well talking of
Cumberland, but one must come to Switzerland
to see that." Every man cannot be a Childe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Harold; and even to be a Childe Harold one must
begin by a stout determination to be unhappy, and
to put up with it. In his own lodgings in London
Robinson has lived a good deal alone, and, though
he has not liked it, he has put up with it. It
has been the business of his life. But he has it
not in him to travel alone and to enjoy it. If,
indeed, the Foreign Office in Whitehall had
entrusted him with a letter or even a teapot, to
carry to the Foreign Office at Vienna, he would
have executed his mission with manly fidelity, and
would have suffered nothing on the journey. The
fact that he had a teapot to convey would have
been enough for his support. But then work is
always so much easier than play.</p>

<p>But he goes on wearily, and still makes an effort
or two. As he falls down into Italy, looking with
listless, unseeing eyes at all the prettinesses of
the Ticino, he comes upon another Robinson, and
there is a chance for him. But he has unconsciously
learned and despised his own littleness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and in that other lonely one he fears to find one
as small, or it may be smaller than himself. He
gathers his toga round him, in the shape of knapsack
and walking-stick, with somewhat of dignity,
and looks at his brother with suspicious eye. His
brother makes some faint effort at fraternization,
such as he had made before, and then Robinson,&mdash;our
Robinson,&mdash;is off. He wants a companion
sorely, but he does not want one who shall be so
low in the world's reckoning as to want him. So
he passes on, and having at last tramped out with
weary feet his six weeks of wretched vacation, he
returns home rejoicing to think that on the
morrow he shall be back amidst the comforts of
his desk and stool, and the society of his fellow-labourers.</p>

<p>Most of us are Robinsons. We are so far lucky
indeed, the greater number of us, that we need
not be solitary Robinsons. We have our friends,
and are better advised than to attempt the enjoyment
of our tours alone. But as to our capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for doing so, or our conduct if we should attempt
it, I doubt whether many of us would be much
stronger than he was.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="unprotected" id="unprotected">THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE TOURIST.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
The</span> unprotected female tourist is generally a much
stronger-minded individual than the solitary male
traveller, and has a higher purpose, a better courage,
and a greater capacity for meeting and conquering
the difficulties of the road. The poor fellow,
indeed, whose solitary journey we described the
other day, had no purpose, unless a vague idea
of going where amusement would come to him,
rather than of seeking it by any effort of his
own, may be called a purpose; but the unprotected
female knows what she is about; she has
something to do and she does it; she has a
defined plan from which nothing moves her; the
discomfort of a day will not turn her aside; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
will she admit of any social overtures till she has
formed a judgment of their value, and has fair
reason to believe that she will receive at any rate
as much as she gives. The unprotected female,
as she knows and uses the strength of her weakness,
so does she perceive and measure the
weakness of her strength. She cannot be impetuous,
and impulsive, and kitten-like, as may
girls who can retreat at once behind their mother's
crinoline or under their father's umbrella, should a
cloud be seen in the distance or the need for shelter
be felt.</p>

<p>How or under what influences the unprotected
female commences her tour, who can tell? It
will usually be found, if inquiry be made as to
her family, that she has a brother, or a father,
or a mother; that she need not be an unprotected
female tourist, had she not elected that line as the
best for her pleasure or her profit. She is seldom
very young;&mdash;but neither is she very old. The lady
whose age would admit of her travelling alone without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
remark rarely chooses to do so; and when she
does, she is not the lady whom we all know as
the unprotected female. The unprotected female
must be pretty, or must at least possess feminine
graces which stand in lieu of prettiness, and which
can put forward a just and admitted claim for
personal admiration. She is not rich, and travels
generally with economy; but she is rarely brought
to a shift for money, and her economies conceal
themselves gracefully and successfully. She learns
the value of every franc, of every thaler, of every
zwansiger as she progresses, and gets more change
out of her sovereigns than any Englishman will
do. She allows herself but few self-indulgences,
and controls her appetites. She can enjoy a good
dinner as well as her brother could do; but she
can go without her dinner with a courageous
persistence of which her brother knows nothing.
She never pays through the nose in order that
people indifferent to her may think her great or
generous, though she pays always sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
escape unsatisfactory noises and to prevent
unpleasant demands. Her dress is quiet and yet
attractive; her clothes fit her well; and if, as
one is prone to suspect, they are in great part
the  work of  her own  hand, she must be an
industrious woman, able to go to her needle at
night after the heat and dust of the day are
over. Her gloves are never worn at the finger-ends;
her hat is never shapeless, nor are her
ribbons ever soiled; the folds of her not too
redundant drapery are never misarranged, confused,
or angular. She never indulges in bright
colours, and is always the same, and always neat;
and they who know her best believe that if she
were called out of her room by fire in the middle
of the night, she would come forth calm, in
becoming apparel, and ready to take an active
part in the emergency without any infringement
on  feminine  propriety.  She is never forward,
nor is she ever bashful.  A bashful woman could
not play her game, and a forward woman immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
encounters sorrow when she attempts to
play it. She can decline all overtures of acquaintanceship
without giving offence, and she can glide
into intimacies without any apparent effort. She can
speak French with fluency and with much more than
average accuracy, and probably knows something of
German and Italian. Without such accomplishments
as these let no woman undertake the part
of an unprotected female tourist. She can converse
on almost any subject; and, if called on
to do so, can converse without any subject. As
she becomes experienced in her vocation she learns
and remembers all the routes of travelling. She
is acquainted with and can explain all galleries,
cathedrals, and palaces. She knows the genealogies
of the reigning kings, and hardly loses herself
among German dukes. She understands politics,
and has her opinion about the Emperor, the King
of Prussia, and the Pope. And she can live with
people who know much more than herself, or
much less, without betraying the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
herself and them. She can be gay with
the gay, and enjoy that; or dull with the dull,
and seem to enjoy that. What man as he travels
learns so much, works so hard, uses so much
mental power, takes so much trouble in all things,
as she does? She is never impatient, never
exacting, never cross, never conquered, never
triumphant, never humble, never boastful, never
ill, never in want of assistance. If she fall into
difficulties she escapes from them without a complaint.
If she be ill-used she bears it without
a murmur; if disappointed,&mdash;as must so often
be the case with her,&mdash;she endures her cross and
begins again with admirable assiduity. Yet she is
only an unprotected female, and they who meet
her on her travels are too apt to declare that she
is an old soldier.</p>

<p>Unprotected female tourists, such as I have
described, are not very numerous; but there are
enough of them to form a class by themselves.
From year to year, as we make our autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
excursions, we see perhaps one of them, and
perhaps a second. We meet the same lady two
or three times, making with her a pleasant acquaintance,
and then passing on. The farther we go
afield the more likely we are to encounter her.
She is always to be met with on the Nile; she
is quite at home at Constantinople; she goes
frequently to Spain; you will probably find her
in Central America; but her head-quarters are
perhaps at Jerusalem. She prefers the saddle
to any other mode of travelling, and can sit on
horseback for any number of hours without
flinching. For myself, I have always liked the
company of the unprotected female, and have
generally felt something like the disruption of
a tender friendship when circumstances have torn
me from her.</p>

<p>But why is she what she is? As to the people
that one ordinarily meets when travelling, no one
stops to inquire why they are what they are.
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson have come together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
naturally enough; and, naturally enough, there
are three or four Miss Thompsons. And when
young Mr. Thompson turns up alone, no one
thinks very much about him. But one is driven
to think why Miss Thompson is there at Cairo
all by herself. You go to the Pyramids with
her, and you find her to be very pleasant. She
sits upon her donkey as though she had been
born sitting on a donkey; and through dust and
heat and fleas and Arabs she makes herself
agreeable as though nothing were amiss with
her. You find yourself talking to her of your
mother, your sister, or your friend,&mdash;but not of
your wife or sweetheart. But of herself, excepting
as regards her life at Cairo, she says nothing to
you. You ask yourself many questions about her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who was her father? who was her mother?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had she a sister? had she a brother?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was there a dearer one still, and a nearer one<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Yet than all other?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why is she alone? and how is it possible that a
girl whose dress fits her so nicely should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have "a nearer one and dearer one yet than all
other?"</p>

<p>But you may take it for granted that she has
not; or if she has, that he is no better than he
should be;&mdash;that his nature is such as to have
driven her to think solitude better than his company.
Love of independence has probably made
the unprotected female tourist what she is;&mdash;that
and the early acquired knowledge that such independence
in a woman requires very special training.
She has probably said to herself that she
would rise above the weakness of her sex,&mdash;driven,
perhaps, to that resolve by some special grief
which, as a woman, she has incurred. She is
something of a Bohemian, but a Bohemian with a
regret that Bohemianism should be necessary to
her. She will not be hindered by her petticoats
from seeing what men see, and from enjoying that
which Nature seems to bring within a man's reach
so easily, but which is so difficult to a woman.
That there might be something more blessed than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that independence she is ready enough to admit
to herself. Where is the woman that does not
admit it? But she will not admit that a woman
should live for that hope alone; and therefore
she is riding with you to the Pyramids,&mdash;others
of course accompanying you,&mdash;and talking to you
with that studied ease which is intended to show
that, though she is an unprotected female, she
knows what she is about, and can enjoy herself
without any fear of you, or of Mrs. Grundy. You
find her to be very clever, and then think her to
be very pretty; and if,&mdash;which may probably be
the case,&mdash;you are in such matters a fool, you say
a word or two more than you ought to do, and the
unprotected female shows you that she can protect
herself.</p>

<p>But Miss Thompson is wrong for all this, and
I think it will be admitted that I have made the
best of Miss Thompson's case. The line which
she has taken up is one which it is impossible
that a woman should follow with ultimate satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
She cannot unsex herself or rid herself
of the feeling that admiration is accorded to her
as a pretty woman. She has probably intended,&mdash;honestly
intended,&mdash;to be quit of that feeling,
and to move about the world as though, for her,
men and women were all the same, as though no
more flirting were possible, and love-making were
a thing simply good to be read of in novels. But
if so, why has she been so careful with her gloves,
and her hat, and all her little feminine belongings?
It has been impossible to her not to
be a woman. The idea and remembrance of her
womanly charms have always been there, always
present to her mind. Unmarried men are to her
possible lovers and possible husbands,&mdash;as she is
also a possible wife to any unmarried man,&mdash;and
also a possible love. Though she may have
devoted herself to celibacy with her hand on the
altar, she cannot banish from her bosom the idea
which, despite herself, almost forms itself into a
hope. We will not ask as to her past life; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
for the future she will be what she is,&mdash;only till
the chance comes to her of being something
better. It is that free life which she leads,&mdash;which
she leads in all innocency,&mdash;which makes it
impossible for her to be true to the resolution she
has made for herself. Such a woman cannot talk
to men without a consciousness that intimacy may
lead to love, or the pretence of love, or the
dangers of love. Nor, it may be said, can any
unmarried woman do so. And therefore it is
that they do not go about the world unprotected,
either at home or abroad. Therefore it is that the
retreat behind mamma's ample folds or beneath
papa's umbrella is considered to be so salutary.</p>

<p>You, my friend, with your quick, impulsive,
and, allow me to say, meaningless expression of
admiration, received simply the rebuke which you
deserved. Then there was an end of that, and
Miss Thompson, being somewhat used to such
misadventures, thought but little of it afterwards.
She has to do those things when the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
comes upon her. But it does happen, sometimes,
that the unprotected female,&mdash;who has a heart,
though other women will say that she has none,&mdash;is
touched, and listens, and hopes, and at last
almost thinks that she has found out her mistake.
The cold exterior glaze of the woman is pricked
through, and there comes a scratch upon the stuff
beneath. A tone in her voice will quaver as
though everything were not easy with her. She
will forget for the moment her prudence, and the
usual precautions of her life, and will dream of
retiring within the ordinary pale of womanhood.
She will think that to cease to be an unprotected
female may be sweet, and for a while she will be
soft, and weak, and wavering. But with unprotected
females such ideas have to pass away very
fleetly. I am afraid it must be said that let a
woman once be an unprotected female, so she
must remain to the end. Who knows the man
that has taken an unprotected female to his bosom
and made her the mistress of his home, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
chief priestess of his household gods? And if
any man have done so, what have his friends said
of him and his adventure?</p>

<p>And so the unprotected female goes on wandering
still farther afield, increasing in cleverness
every year, and ever acquiring new knowledge;
but increasing also in hardness, and in that glaze
of which I have spoken, till at last one is almost
driven to confess, when one's wife and daughters
declare her to be an old soldier, that one's wife
and daughters are not in justice liable to contradiction.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="united" id="united">THE UNITED ENGLISHMEN WHO
TRAVEL FOR FUN.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
The</span> United Englishmen who travel for fun are
great nuisances to other tourists, are great
nuisances to the towns they visit and the scenes
they disturb, are often nuisances in a small way
to the police, are nuisances to people saying
their prayers in churches, are nuisances to visitors
in picture galleries, are nuisances to the ordinary
travellers of the day, and are nuisances to the
world at large&mdash;except the innkeepers and the
railway companies; but they generally achieve
their own object, and have what the Americans
call a good time of it. A United Englishman
travelling for fun should not be over twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
years of age, but up to that age what he does,
though he be a nuisance, should be forgiven him.
Though we ourselves may be annoyed by the
freaks of such travellers, shocked by their utter
disregard of apparel, stunned by their noises,
and ashamed of them as our countrymen, yet we
are well pleased that our sons should be among
their number, and are conscious that amidst all
that energetic buffoonery and wild effrontery,
education is going on, and that much is being
learned, though the recipient of the learning
would himself be ashamed to own any such fact
to himself.</p>

<p>The men of whom I am now speaking are
generally gentlemen by birth,&mdash;who have been
educated or missed being educated, as education
is obtained or missed by the sons of English
gentlemen,&mdash;are pleasant fellows who have learned
to love each other at school or college, and have
nothing about them that is mean or in itself
ignoble; but they are young of their age, men for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
whom nature has hitherto done more than art,
who have hardly as yet learned to think, and are
still enjoying all the irresponsible delights of
boyhood at a time of life at which others less
fortunate are already immersed in the grievous
cares of earning their bread. I do not know that
any country except England produces such a crop.
We see United Frenchmen on their travels; but
they are discreet, well dressed, anticipating the
life of middle age rather than adhering to the
manners of boyhood,&mdash;much given to little attentions
to women, and very decorous in their
language. And young German tourists are encountered
everywhere, though more often alone
than in union; but the German tourist is almost
always a German student. Life is a serious
thing to him, and he is resolved that he will not
lose this most precious period of it. United
Germans, rough in their pleasures, and noisy in
their demonstrations, may no doubt be found;
but they are to be found in their own cities, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
their universities, among their own people. It
does not come in their way to go forth and
exhibit their rowdiness among strangers. And
as to Americans, who has ever seen a young
American? An American who travels at eighteen,
travels because he is blasé with the world at home,
tired of democratic politics, and anxious to see
whether anything may still be gleaned from
European manners to improve the not yet perfected
institutions of his own country. Among
tourists of the order of United Englishmen an
American young man is altogether out of his
element. He will attempt sometimes to live as
they live, but will soon retire, disgusted partly
by them and partly by his own incompetence. I
have known an American who could be loud, and
jolly, and frolicsome, and yet carry himself like a
gentleman through it all; but I have never known
a young American who could do so.</p>

<p>Englishmen of the class in question are boys
for a more protracted period of their life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
remain longer in a state of hobbledehoyhood,
than the youths probably of any other nation.
They are nurtured on the cold side of the wall,
and come slowly to maturity; but the fruit, which
is only half ripe at the end of summer, is the
fruit that we keep for our winter use. I do not
know that much has been lost in life by him who,
having been a boy at twenty, is still a young man
at forty. But even in England we are changing
all this now-a-days, and by a liberal use of the
hot-water pipes of competition are in a way to
force our fruit into the market as early as any
other people. Let us hope that what we gain in
time may not be lost in flavour.</p>

<p>But we have not yet advanced so far as to put
down the bands of United Englishmen who travel
for fun. Who does not know the look of the
band, and cannot at a glance swear to their vocation?
The smallest number of such a party
is three, and it does not often exceed five. They
are dressed very much alike. The hat, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
be its exact shape, is chosen with the purpose of
setting all propriety instantly at defiance. No
other description can be given of it. To say
that it is a slouch hat, or a felt hat, or a Tom-and-Jerry
hat, conveys no idea of the hat in
question. The most discreet Low Church parson
may wear a slouch hat, and may look in it as
discreet and as Low Church as he does in his
economically preserved chimney-pot at home.
But the United English tourist batters his hat,
and twists it, and sits on it, and rumples and
crumples it, till it is manifestly and undeniably
indicative of its owner. And having so completed
its manufacture he obtrudes it upon the world
with a remarkable ingenuity. In a picture gallery
he will put it on the head of a bust of Apollo; in
a church he will lay it down on the railing of the
altar, or he will carry it on high on the top of
his stick, so that all men may see it and know
its owner by the sign. Sitting in public places
he will chuck it up and catch it, and at German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
beer-gardens he will spread it carefully in the
middle of the little table intended for the glasses.
He never keeps it on his head when he should take
it off,&mdash;because he is a gentleman; but he rarely
keeps it on his head when that is the proper place
for it,&mdash;because he is a United Englishman who
travels for fun. He wears a suit of grey clothes,
the coat being a shooting coat, and the trousers,
if he be loud in his vocation, being exchanged for
knickerbockers. And it is remarkable that the suit
in which you will see him will always strike you
as that which he had procured for last year's tour,
and that he is economically wearing it to shreds
on the present occasion. But this is not so. The
clothes were new when he left London; but he
has been assiduous with his rumpling and crumpling
here as he has been with his hat, and at the
expiration of his first week out he is able to boast
to himself that he has, at any rate, got rid of the
gloss. He wears flannel shirts, and in warm
weather goes about without a cravat. He carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in his portmanteau a dress-coat, waistcoat, and
trousers, which are of no use to him, as who
would think of asking such a man to dinner?
But, as he abhors the extra package which a
decent hat would make needful, he is to be seen
in Paris, Vienna, or Florence with that easily-recognized
covering for his head which I have
above described. He has a bludgeon usually in
his hand, and often a pipe in his mouth. He
knows nothing of gloves, but is very particular as
to the breadth and strength of his shoes. He
often looks to be very dirty; but his morning
tub is a religious ceremony, and, besides that, he
bathes whenever he comes across a spot which,
from its peculiar difficulties, is more than ordinarily
inappropriate for the exercise.</p>

<p>These tourists for fun are known well by all
that large class of men who are engaged in
supplying the wants of summer travellers. No
one ever doubts their solvency; no innkeeper
ever refuses them admittance; no station-master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
or captain of a steamboat ever takes them for
other than they are. They are not suspected,
but known; and therefore a certain tether is
allowed to them which is not to be exceeded.
They are looked after good-humouredly, and are
so restrained that they shall not be made to feel
the restraint if the feeling can be spared them.
"Three mad Englishmen! They're all right.
I've got my eye on them. They won't do any
harm?" That seems to be the ordinary language
which is held about them by those to whom falls
the duty of watching them and supplying their
wants. The waiters were very good-natured to
them, patting them, as it were on the back, and
treating them much as though they were children.
But it is understood that they must have wherewithal
to eat and to drink well, and that their
bells must be answered if any quiet is to be
preserved in the houses. Sometimes there will be
a row, and the English pride will flare up and
conceive itself to have been insulted. The United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Englishman who travels for fun has a great idea
of his country's power, and resents violently any
uncourteous interference with his vagaries. But
it is so generally known that the "mad Englishman"
is all right, and that he won't do any real
harm if an eye be kept on him, that such rows
seldom end disastrously.</p>

<p>These united tourists often quarrel among
themselves, but their quarrels do not come to
much. Green tells White that Brown is the most
ill-tempered, evil-minded, cross-grained brute that
was ever born, that he thought so before and that
now he knows it; that he was a fool to come
abroad with such a beast, and that he was
absolutely, finally, and irrevocably resolved that
never, under any circumstances, will he speak to
the man again. The party will be broken up,
but he cannot help that. There will be difficulty
about the division of money, but he cannot help
that. Yes; it is true that he is fond of Brown's
sister, but neither can he help that. It has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
been his wonder that such a sister should have
such a brother. Only for Mary Brown he never
would have come abroad with this pig of a fellow.
The quarrel while it rages is very hot, and Brown
tells White that Green is the greatest ass under
the sun. Nevertheless the quarrel is made up
before breakfast on the following morning, and
the three men go on together without much
remembrance of the language which they had
used.</p>

<p>I have said that most of us would like to see
our sons go out on such parties, and I think that
we should be right in sending them. The United
Englishmen who travel for fun rarely get into
much evil. They do not get drunk, nor do they
gamble at the public tables. And undoubtedly
they learn much, though it seems that they are
always averse to learn anything. How education
is accomplished or of what it consists, who yet has
been able to explain to us? That by far the
greater portion of our education is involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
all men will probably admit. We learn to speak,
to walk, to express our emotions, and to control
such expression; to be grave and gay, and to
understand the necessity of alternating between
the two, by copying others unconsciously. We
exercise a thousand arts which we do not know
how we acquired, and the more we see of the world
the more do we learn of such arts,&mdash;even though
we are not aware of the process. That our friends
Brown, Green, and White might have learned more
than they did learn on that tour of theirs, may be
true enough; but for all that, they do not come
back as empty as they went.</p>

<p>And they have had this merit,&mdash;that they have in
truth enjoyed what they have done. Little clouds
there have been,&mdash;such as that quarrel between
Brown and his future brother-in-law; but they
have been passing mists which have hardly served
to disturb the sunshine of their tour. Together
they started, together they have been over mountains
and through cities, performing feats which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in their own judgments, are little short of marvellous,
and together they return at the end of
their holiday satisfied with themselves and with
the world at large. They have seen pictures and
walked through cathedrals; but, above all, they
have stood upon the slopes of the hills and have
looked at the mountains. They have listened to
the little rivers as they tumbled, and have laid
their hands upon the edges of mighty rocks; they
have smelt the wild thyme as it gave out its
fragrance beneath their feet, and have peered
wondering through the blue crevasses of the
glacier. They have sat in the sweet gloom of
the evening and have watched the surface of the
lake as it lay beneath them without a ripple, and
have waited there till the curtain of night has hid
the water from their view. Then they have thrown
themselves idly on their backs, and have counted
the stars in the firmament over their head, wondering
at the beauty of the heavens. They have said
little perhaps to each other of the romance of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
moments, of the poetry, which has filled their
hearts; but the romance and the poetry have been
there; and they have brought home with them a
feeling for beauty which will last them through
their lives, in spite of their crumpled hats, their
big bludgeons, their short pipes, and their now
almost indecent knickerbockers.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="art" id="art">THE ART TOURIST.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
The</span> class of art tourists is very numerous, and of
all tourists the art tourist is, I think, the most
indefatigable. He excels the tourist in search of
knowledge both in length of hours and in assiduity
while he is at his work. The art tourist now described
is not the man or woman who goes abroad
to learn to paint, or to buy pictures and gems, or
to make curious art investigations. Such travellers
are necessarily few in number, and set about
their work as do other people of business. They
are not tourists at all in the now accepted meaning
of the word. Our art tourist is he,&mdash;or quite as
often she,&mdash;who flies from gallery to gallery,
spending hours and often days in each, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
strong determination to get up conscientiously
the subject of pictures. Sculpture and architecture
come also within the scope of the labours
of the art tourist, but not to such an extent as
to influence them materially. Pictures are the
ever present subject of the English art tourist's
thoughts, and to them and their authors he devotes
himself throughout his holiday with that laborious
perseverance which distinguishes the true Briton
as much in his amusement as in his work. He
is studying painters rather than pictures,&mdash;certainly
not pictures alone as things pleasing in
themselves. A picture, of which the painter is
avowedly unknown, is to such a one a thing of
almost no interest whatever,&mdash;unless in the more
advanced period of his study he should venture
to attempt to read the riddle and should take
upon himself to name the unknown. And this
work of the art tourist, though it may lead to a
true love of pictures, does in no wise arise from
any such feeling. And, indeed, it is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
compatible with an entire absence of any such
predilection. Men become learned in pictures
without caring in the least for their beauty or
their ugliness, just as other men become learned
in the laws, without any strong feeling either as
to their justice or injustice. The lawyer looks
probably for a return for his labours in a comfortable
income, and the art tourist looks for his
return in that sort of reputation which is now
attached to the knowledge of the history of
painting.</p>

<p>The first great object of the art tourist is to
be able to say, without reference to any card,
guide-book, or affixed name, and with some
approach to correctness, who painted the picture
then before him; and his next great object is
to be able to declare the date of that painter's
working, the country in which he lived, the
master who taught him, the school which he
founded, the name of his mistress or wife, the
manner of his death, and the galleries in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
his chief works are now to be found.</p>

<p>As regards the first object,&mdash;that of knowing
the painter from his work,&mdash;the art tourist soon
obtains many very useful guides to his memory.
Indeed, it is on guides to his memory that he
depends altogether. When he has progressed so
far that he can depend on his judgment instead
of his memory, he has ceased to be an art tourist,
and has become a connoisseur. The first guide
to memory is the locality of the picture. He
knows that Raphaels are rife at Florence, Titians
at Venice, Vandykes at Genoa, Guidos at Bologna,
Van Eykes and Memlings in Flanders, and Rembrandts
and Paul Potters in Holland. Pictures
have been too much scattered about to make
this knowledge alone good for much; but joined
to other similar aids, it is a powerful assistance,
and prevents mistakes which in an old art tourist
would be disgraceful. Next to this, probably,
he acquires a certain, though not very accurate
idea of dates, which supplies him with information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from the method and manner of the picture.
If he is placed before a work of some early Tuscan
painter,&mdash;Orcagna, or the like,&mdash;he will know
that it is not the work of some comparatively
modern painter of the same country,&mdash;such as
Andrea del Sarto;&mdash;and so he progresses. Then
the old masters themselves were very liberal in
the aids which they gave to memory by repeating
their own work,&mdash;as, indeed, are some of
their modern followers, who love to produce the
same faces year after year upon their canvas,&mdash;I
will not say usque ad nauseam, for how can
we look on a pretty face too often? The old
masters delighted to paint their own wives or
their own mistresses,&mdash;the women, in short,
whom they loved best and were most within
their reach, guided perhaps by some idea of
economy in saving the cost of a model; and
this peculiarity on their part is a great assistance
to art tourists. He or she must be a very young
art tourist who does not know the Murillo face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
or the two Rubens faces, or the special Raphael
face, or the Leonardo da Vinci face, or the
Titian head and neck, or the Parmigianino
bunch of hair, or the Correggio forehead and
fingers. All this is a great assistance, and
gives hope to an art tourist in a field of inquiry
so wide that there could hardly be any hope
without such aid. And then these good-natured
artists had peculiar tricks with them, which give
further most valuable help to the art tourist in
his work. Jacobo Bassano paints people ever
cringing towards the ground, and consequently a
Jacobo Bassano can be read by a young art
tourist in an instant. Claude Lorraine delighted
to insert a man carrying a box. That vilest of
painters, Guercino, rejoices in turbans. Schalken
painted even scenes by candle-light, so that he
was called Della Notte. Jan Steen usually greets
us with a portrait of himself in a state of
drunkenness. Adrian van Ostade seldom omits
a conical-shaped hat, or Teniers a red cap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a peculiar figure, for which the art tourist
always looks immediately when he thinks of
discovering this artist. All these little tricks of
the artist, and many more of the same kind,
the art tourist soon learns, much to his own
comfort.</p>

<p>And then he progresses to a kind of knowledge
which comes somewhat nearer to art criticism,
but which does not yet amount to the exercise
of any judgment on his own part. He learns
to perceive the peculiar manner of certain artists
who painted peculiarly; and though by the
knowledge he so attains he may be led into
error,&mdash;as when he takes a Lancret for a Watteau,&mdash;still
the error is never disgracefully erroneous.
He knows at once the girl by Greuze,
with her naked shoulder and her head on one
side; he knows at once the old woman by Denner,
the little wrinkles on whose face, as he looks
at them through his magnifying glass, seem to
be so very soft. The unnatural sunshine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Claude he knows, and the natural sunshine of
Cuyp. The blotches of Rembrandt and the
smoothness of Carlo Dolci are to him as A, B, C.
The romantic rocks and trees of Salvator Rosa
do not certainly represent nature,&mdash;to which
they bear no resemblance,&mdash;but to him they
represent Salvator Rosa very adequately. The
pietistic purity of Fra Angelico strikes him
forcibly, and the stiff grace of Perugino; though,
when he advances as far as this, he is somewhat
prone to make mistakes. And he learns to note
the strong rough work of the brush of Paul
Veronese, and the beautiful blue hills of Titian's
backgrounds. He distinguishes between the graceful
dignity of a Venetian nobleman and the manly
bearing of a Florentine citizen; and he recognizes
the spears of Paolo Uccello, who painted
battles; and the beards of Taddeo Gaddi, who
painted saints; and the long-visaged virgins with
fair hair, by Sandro Botticelli. And he will
gradually come to perceive how those long-visaged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
fair-haired virgins grew out of the first
attempts at female dignity by Cimabue, and
how they progressed into the unnatural grace
of Raphael, and then descended into the meretricious
inanities of which Raphael's power and
Raphael's falseness were the forerunners.</p>

<p>And so the art tourist goes on till he really
knows something about painting,&mdash;even whether
he have a taste or no,&mdash;and becomes proud of
himself and his subject. That second object
of which I have spoken, and which has reference
to the life of the painter, he of course acquires
from books. And it may be remarked that the
popularity of this kind of knowledge has become
so strong that much of the information is given
in the ordinary guide-books. We do not much
care to know who taught Christopher Wren to
be an architect, or whence Mozart learned the
art of music, or even how Canova became a
sculptor. But it is essential to the art tourist,
to the youngest tyro in art touring, that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
know that Titian was the scholar of Bellini, and
Raphael of Perugino, and Vandyke of Rubens.
The little intricacies of the schooling,&mdash;how this
man migrated from one school to another, and
how the great pernicious schools of art at last
formed themselves, destroying individual energy,&mdash;these
come afterwards. But to the diligent
art tourist they do come. And it is delightful
to hear the contests on the subject of art
tourists who have formed themselves, one on
Kugler and another on Waagen; who have read
the old work of Vasari, or have filled themselves
with a widely-extended mass of art information
from the late excellent book by Mr.
Wornum.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this has been the creation
of a distinct and new subject of investigation
and study. Men and women get up painting
as other men and women get up botany, or
entomology, or conchology, and a very good
subject painting is for the purpose. It is innocent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pretty, and cheap;&mdash;for I take the fact
of the tour to be given as a matter of course.
It leads its pursuers to nothing disagreeable,
and is as open to women as to men. And it
leads to very little boring of other people who
are not tourists, which, perhaps, is its greatest
advantage; for though the art tourist will sometimes
talk to you of pictures, what is that to
the persecution which you are called on to endure
in inspecting cupboards full of pickled snakes
or legions of drawers full of empty egg-shells?
The work of an art tourist must at least be
more attractive than the unalluring task of collecting
postage-stamps and monograms. And,
above all, let it be remembered that if it so
chance that the art tourist have an eye in his
head, he may at last become a lover of art.</p>

<p>The work of the art tourist begins about the
middle of September, is carried on hotly for
that and the next three months, and then
completes its season at Rome in Easter. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
flourishes, however, only in autumn, as the
normal art tourist is one who is either away
from his business for his holiday, or whose
period of travelling is dependent on some such
person. The work is begun at the Louvre, for
the disciple in this school of learning will never
condescend to use our own National Gallery,
though for the purposes of such learning our own
is perhaps the best gallery in the world. He
begins in the Louvre; and, indeed, in the tribune
of that gallery, under the influence of the great
picture by Paul Veronese, which is probably the
most marvellous piece of painting in the world,
the resolution to get up painting is often taken
by the young scholar. Then the galleries of
Italy are seen&mdash;Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome,
and perhaps Naples; Antwerp and Bruges probably
come next; and then Dresden, Munich,
and Vienna. By this time the art tourist is no
longer a tyro, but, stored with much knowledge,
burns for the acquisition of more. He pines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
after Madrid and Seville, and steals a day or
two from some year's holiday for Amsterdam
and the Hague. He works hard and conscientiously
at his galleries, as though he could turn
aside in idleness from no wall, on which pictures
are hung, without dishonesty.</p>

<p>And then how the subject swells before him
when he takes to fresco-painting, and begins to
despise easel pictures! He penetrates to Assisi,
and declares the Campo Santo at Pisa to be the
centre of the world of Art! He expatiates to you
with vigour on the chapel in the Carmine, and
turns from you in disgust when he finds that you
don't know what that chapel is, or where that
chapel may be.</p>

<p>There is an old saying, which the world still
holds to be very true, but which is, nevertheless, I
think, very false: "Whatever you do, do well."
Now there are many things which are worth doing
which cannot be done well without the devotion of
a lifetime, and which certainly are not worth such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
devotion as that. Billiards is a pretty game, but
to play billiards well is a dangerous thing. And
chess is a beautiful game; but they who play chess
really well can rarely do much else. Art tourists
are in this danger, that it is quite possible they
may teach themselves to think that they should do
their art touring so well as to make that the one
pleasurable pursuit of their lives. After all, it is
but a collecting of dead leaves, unless the real
aptitude and taste be there.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="tourist" id="tourist">THE TOURIST IN SEARCH OF
KNOWLEDGE.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
I think</span> that we all know the tourist in search of
knowledge, the tourist who goes abroad determined
not to waste a day, who is resolved to
bring back with him when he returns from his
travels information that shall be at any rate an
equivalent to him for the money and time expended.
This tourist in search of knowledge no
doubt commands our respect in a certain degree.
He is a sedulous man, probably exempt from any
strong evil proclivities, anxious to do the best he
can with his life, imbued with a respectable ambition,
and animated by that desire to be better than
those around him which generally saves a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
from being below the average if it does not
suffice to do more for him than that. But, having
said so much in praise of tourists of this class, I
do not know that there is much more to be said
in their favour. Such men are usually bores as
regards their effect upon others; and, as regards
themselves, they seem in too many cases to have
but little capacity for following up the special
career which they have proposed to themselves.
They are diligent in their inquiries, but have laid
down for themselves no course of study. They
wish to learn everything, but have too great a
faith for learning everything easily. They have
seldom realized to themselves how hard is the
task of mastering information, and think that in
going far afield from their own homes they have
found, or are like to find, a royal road to knowledge.
And then they have a worse fault than
this incorrectness of idea which I have imputed
to them. They are apt to forestall the merits
which they should in truth never claim till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
knowledge has been won, and as seekers for
wisdom, assume the graces which others should
give them when such acquired wisdom has become
the manifest result of their labours.</p>

<p>There are female tourists in search of knowledge
as well as male; but a woman has so much
more tact than a man, that she is usually able to
hide that which is objectionable in her mode of
action. Perhaps the middle-aged single lady, or
the lady who is not yet middle-aged but fears that
she may soon become so, is more prone to belong
to this class of travellers than any species of man;
but she keeps her investigations somewhat in the
background, goes through her heavy reading out
of sight, and asks her most pressing questions
<i>sotto voce</i>, when she and her hoped-for informant
are beyond the hearing of the multitude. The
male investigator of Continental facts has no such
reticence. He demands the price of wheat with
bold voice before a crowd of fellow-travellers; he
asks his question as to the population of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
country, and then answers it himself with a tone of
conscious superiority, and he suggests his doubts
as to the political action of the people around him
with an air of omniscience that is intended to
astonish all that stand within hearing of him.</p>

<p>What a glorious thing is knowledge, and how
terrible to us are those lapses of opportunity with
which the consciences of most of us are burdened
in this respect! And to us who are ignorant,
whose lapses in that respect have been too long to
have been numerous, how great the man looms
who has really used his intellect, and exercised
his brain, and stirred his mind! But as he looms
large, so does the ignorant man who affects
acquirements and prides himself on knowledge
which can hardly even be called superficial&mdash;as,
spread it as thin as he may, he cannot make it
cover a surface&mdash;appear infinitesimally mean and
small! The getter-up of quotations from books
which he has never read,&mdash;how vile he is to all of
us! The man who allows it to be assumed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he can understand a subject or a language till he
breaks down, caught in the fact, despised, but
pitied through the extent of his misery,&mdash;how
poor a creature he is in his wretchedness! The
tourist in search of knowledge may of course be a
man infinitely too strong to fall into any of these
pitfalls. He may be modest-minded though ambitious,
silent in his search, conscious of his ignorance
where he is ignorant, and doubtful of his
learning where he is learned. No doubt there are
such English tourists,&mdash;many of them probably
passing from city to city year after year,&mdash;with
eyes and ears more readily open than their
mouths; but not such a one is the tourist of
whom we are here speaking. Travellers such as
they become liable to no remark, and escape the
notice of all observers. But the normal traveller
in search of knowledge, with whom all of us who
are habitual tourists are well acquainted, is altogether
of a different nature. He is the Pharisee
among students. He is always thanking God that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he is not as those idlers who pass from country
to country learning nothing of the institutions of
the people among whom they travel,&mdash;not as that
poor Publican, that lonely traveller, who, standing
apart, hardly daring to open his mouth, asks some
humble question which shows thoroughly and at
once the extent of his ignorance.</p>

<p>Our tourist in search of knowledge,&mdash;the tourist
who is searching for that which he thinks he has
got, but which he never will find,&mdash;is seldom a
very young man. Nor is he often a man stricken
in years. The man over fifty who makes inquiries
with eager pretension but with no fixed aptitudes
in that direction, after the price of flour and the
fluctuations of the population, must be a fool
indeed. The tourist now in question will usually
be progressing from thirty to forty. He is a
severe man in his mien, given to frowning at all
puerilities, and especially hostile to his young
countrymen who travel for fun, in denouncing
whose sins he is prone to put forward his best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
eloquence. Nor is he much more gracious to
young ladies who travel with their mammas, and
who sometimes show a tendency to cultivate the
acquaintance of those scandalous young British
rioters. To the unprotected female tourist he will
sometimes unbend, and will find in her a flattering
listener, and one who is able to understand and
appreciate the depth and breadth of his acquirements.
He generally starts from home alone, but
will occasionally be found joined for a time to a
brother traveller, induced to adopt such company
by sympathy in tastes and motives of economy.
But sympathy in tastes will not carry the two
far together, as, little as may be their capacity
for fathoming depths, each will be able to fathom
the depth of the other. The tourist in search of
knowledge will generally be found dressed in
gaiters, in a decorous suit of brown garments,
and accompanied by a great coat, rug, and umbrella,
carefully packed together with a strap.
Now, in these latter days, he has relinquished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
his chimney-pot, and covered himself with a dark
soft felt hat, which must add greatly to his comfort.
Indeed, his appearance would be much in
his favour, as opposed in its decency to the violent
indecency of some of our British tourists, were it
not for a certain priggishness of apparel which
tells a tale against him and acts terribly to his
disfavour. It must, however, be acknowledged of
the tourist in search of knowledge that he never
misbehaves himself. He is not often to be seen
in the churches during the hours of public worship,&mdash;for
what is there for an inquiring tourist
to learn in such places at such times?&mdash;but when
chance does so place him he disturbs no one, and
entails upon the big Swiss, or verger with the
cocked hat, no necessity to keep an eye upon him.
He is no great frequenter of galleries, preferring
the useful to the ornamental in his inquiries; but
he makes his little tour of inspection to any art
collections that are of especial note, so that he
may be able to satisfy himself and his admirers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that he has seen everything. Occasionally he will
venture on a morsel of art criticism, and then the
profundity of his ignorance is delightful to those
who feel that, as a tourist in search of knowledge,
he is turning up his nose at them. He will generally
admire a "Carlo Dolci," and will have some
word to say in favour of Salvator Rosa. But he
will be found much more frequently in libraries
and museums. These will be his hunting-grounds,
though it will be out of the power of the ordinary
tourist to ascertain what he does there. He is,
however, an enduring, conscientious man, and can
pass along from shelf to shelf and from one glass-covered
repository to another, hardly missing a
stuffed bird or an Indian arrow-head. And he
will listen with wondrous patience to the details
of guides, jotting down figures in a little book,
and asking wonder-working questions which no
guide can answer. And he looks into municipal
matters wherever he goes, learning all details as
to mayors, aldermen, and councillors, as to custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
duties on provisions, as to import duties on manufactures,
as to schools, convents, and gaols, to
scholars, mendicants, and criminals. He does
not often care much for scenery, but he will be
careful to inquire how many passengers the steamboats
carry on the lakes, and what average of souls
is boarded and lodged at each large hotel that he
passes. He would like to know how many eggs
are consumed annually, and probably does ask
some question as to the amount of soap used in
the laundries.</p>

<p>To the romance and transcendental ebullitions
of enthusiastic admirers of nature he is altogether
hostile, and dislikes especially all quotations from
poetry. "Cui bono?" is his motto. To whom
will any of these things do any good? Has Dante
fed any hungry mouths, or has Shakspeare put
clothes on the backs of any but a poor company
of players? He will tell you that Byron wasted
a fortune, and that Shelley wasted himself. The
jingle of rhymes is an injury to him, as is also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
scraping of a fiddle. To get up either poetry or
music would be out of his line, and he recognizes
no utility that does not show itself by figures. So
he goes on from town to town, passing quickly
through the mountains and by the lakes, and conscientiously
performs the task which he had laid out
for himself before he started. When he returns
home he has never been enticed to the right or
to the left. He has spent exactly the number of
francs which he had allowed himself. He had
ordered breakfast to be ready for him in his home
on a certain morning by eight o'clock, and exactly
at that hour he appears and is ready for his meal.
He has kept his journal every day; and, over and
beyond his journal, he has filled a pocket-book
so full of figures that even his methodical mind
can hardly disentangle them from the crowded
pages. He has an idea of publishing an article
on the consumption of rye-flour in Pomerania, and
is a happy man until he finds that the effort is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
beyond his power.</p>

<p>But he has had no holiday, and it may be
doubted whether such a man wants any holiday;
whether the capability of enjoying holiday-time
has been vouchsafed to him. To sit on a mountain-side
and breathe sweeter air than that which
his daily work affords him gives him no delight.
Neither the rivers nor the clouds nor the green
valleys have been dear to him. But he has worked
conscientiously in his vocation, and in the result
of that work will be his reward. If his memory
serves him, or even if it does not, he will be able
to repeat among friends and foes an amount of
facts which will show that he has not been a tourist
in search of knowledge for nothing.</p>

<p>That such a man has made a mistake in his
ideas as to knowledge and in his mode of seeking
it may be our opinion and that of some others,
and yet may be a very false opinion. And we
may certainly confess that any true searching
after knowledge must be beneficial, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the method of the search may to our eyes and in
our estimation be ungainly and inefficacious. It
is not against the search that protest is here made.
It is against the pretence of the man that our
battle is waged, against the broad phylacteries
worn so openly on the foreheads of utilitarian
tourists that our little shafts are pointed. Let
the tourist in search of knowledge work hard and
despise all holiday-making, and sacrifice himself
to statistics, if he have strength and will to do so;
but in doing so, let him cease to thank God that
he is not as other men are.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="alpine" id="alpine">THE ALPINE CLUB MAN.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
It</span> would have been easier and much pleasanter
to write of the Alpine Club man, and to describe
his peculiarities and his glories, if that terrible
accident had not happened on the Matterhorn.
It is ill jesting while the sad notes of some
tragic song are still sounding in our ears. But
the Alpine Club man has of late made himself so
prominent among English tourists,&mdash;has become,
with his ropes, his blankets, and his ladders, so
well-acknowledged and much-considered an institution,
that it would be an omission were he not
to be included in our sketches. And, moreover, it
may not be amiss to say yet a word or two as to
the dangers of Alpine Club pursuits,&mdash;a word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
two to be added to all those words that have been
said in these and other columns on the same
subject.</p>

<p>It may well, I think, be made a question whether
we are not becoming too chary of human life;
whether we do not allow ourselves to be shocked
beyond proper measure by the accidental death
of a fellow mortal. There are two points of view
from which we look at these sudden strokes of
fate, which are so distinctly separated in our
minds as to turn each calamity into two calamities;
and the one calamity or the other will be
regarded as the more terrible according to the
religious tendencies of the suffering survivor.
There is the religious point of view, which teaches
us to consider it to be a terrible thing that a man
should be called upon to give up his soul without
an hour for special preparation; and there is the
human point of view, which fills us with an ineffable
regret that one well loved should be taken
from those who loved him, apparently without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
cause,&mdash;with nothing, as we may say, to justify
the loss of a head so dear. As regards the
religious consideration, we know of course that
we are constantly praying, with more or less of
earnestness, that the evil of sudden death may
not come upon us,&mdash;as we pray also that battles
may not come. But yet, if occasion require it,
if the honour of the country seemed to demand
it, we do not hesitate about battles. We may
say, at least, that we never hesitate on account
of the death that must ensue, though we do
hesitate with extreme caution on the score of
the money that must be spent. And we consider,&mdash;if
the cause have been good,&mdash;that the blood
spilt on battle-fields has been well spilt, and that
the lives gallantly rendered there have been well
rendered. But the carnage there has all been the
carnage of sudden death. It may be,&mdash;and yet it
may hardly be,&mdash;that the soldier, knowing the
chances of his profession, shall keep himself prepared
for the death-dealing blow; but if the soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on the eve of battle can do so, then why not he
who is about to climb among the mountain snows?
But, in truth, the subject is one which does not
admit of too curious an inquiry. As we pray to
be removed from sudden death, so do we pray that
we may always be prepared for it. We are going
ever with our lives in our hands, knowing that
death is common to all of us; and knowing also,&mdash;for
all of us who ever think do know it,&mdash;that to
him who dies death must be horrible or blessed,
not in accordance with an hour or two of final
preparation, but as may be the state of the dying
man's parting soul as the final result of the life
which he has led. It suits us in some of our
religious moods to insist much on the special
dangers of sudden death, but they are dangers
which come home in reality to very few of us.
What parson, though praying perhaps daily
against sudden death, believes that his own boy
is specially endangered,&mdash;specially endangered as
regards his soul,&mdash;when he stands with his breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
right before the bullets of his country's enemy?
In war, in commerce, not unfrequently in science,
we disregard utterly the perils of sudden death;
and if, as regards religion, these perils do not
press on us in war and commerce, or in science,
neither should they do so in reference to other
pursuits. Is there any man with a faith so
peculiar as to believe that salvation will be refused
to him who perishes among the mountains
of Europe because his employment is regarded
as an amusement; but that it will be given to
the African traveller because his work is to be
accounted as a work of necessity? For myself,
I do not think that there is a man who so
believes.</p>

<p>And as to the human point of view,&mdash;that
wearing regret which almost melts the heart into
a stream of woe when the calamity comes home
to oneself,&mdash;the argument is nearly the same.
The poor mother whose dear gallant boy has
fallen in battle, as she thinks of her lad's bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
eyes and curling locks, and straight young active
limbs, and of all the glories of the young life
which she herself gave with so many pangs,&mdash;as
she remembers all this, she cannot reconcile
herself to the need of war, nor unless she be a
Spartan, can she teach herself to think that that
dear blood has been well shed for the honour of
her country. And, should he have fallen from
some snowy peak, her judgment of the event will
be simply the same. It will be personal regret,
not judgment. It is equally impossible that she
should console herself in either event by calculating
that the balance of advantage to the community of
which she is a member is on that side to which
courage and the spirit of adventure belong.</p>

<p>In our personal regrets we must all think of our
individual cases; but in discussing such a question
as belonging to England at large, we can only
regard the balance of advantage. And if we
find that that spirit of enterprise which cannot
have its full swing, or attain its required momentum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
without the fatality which will attend
danger, leads to happy results,&mdash;that it makes
our men active, courageous, ready in resource,
prone to friendship, keen after gratifications which
are in themselves good and noble; that it leads
to pursuits which are in themselves lovely, and
to modes of life which are worthy of admiration,
then let us pay the necessary cost of such happy
results without repining. That we should, all of
us, have a tear of sorrow for those gallant fellows
who perished on the Matterhorn is very good;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would not sing for Lycidas?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But shall it be said among us that no boat is
again to be put off from our shores because that
one "fatal and perfidious bark" was "built in
the eclipse?"</p>

<p>There is a fate infinitely worse than sudden
death,&mdash;the fate of him who is ever fearing it.
"Mors omnibus est communis." We all know it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and it is the excitement coming from that knowledge
which makes life pleasant to us. When
we hear of a man who is calm and collected
under every danger, we know that we hear of a
happy man. In hunting, in shooting, in yachting,
in all adventures, in all travelling,&mdash;I had almost
said in love-making itself,&mdash;the cream of the charm
lies in the danger. But danger will not be danger
long if none of the natural results of danger come;
and the cream of such amusements would, under
such safe circumstances, soon become poor and
vapid as skim-milk. I would say that it is to
be hoped that that accident on the Matterhorn
may not repress the adventurous spirit of a single
English mountain-climber, did I not feel so sure
that there will be no such repression as to leave
no room for hoping.</p>

<p>And now for a word or two about the Alpine
Club men, who have certainly succeeded in making
their club an institution, clearly to be recognized
on the face of the earth. Whether rational or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
irrational in his work, the Alpine Club man has
been successful in his pursuit. A few years since,&mdash;how
very few it seems to be!&mdash;to have gone up
Mont Blanc was a feat which almost opened the
gates of society to the man who had done it;
but Mont Blanc is now hardly more than equal
to the golden ball on the top of St. Paul's Cathedral.
There will soon be no peak not explored, no
summit in Europe that is not accessible, no natural
fortress that has not been taken. The Alpine
Club will have used up Switzerland, and the
present hunting-grounds of these sportsmen will
be expended. But money increases quickly, and
distances decrease; wings that a few years since
were hardly strong enough for a flight over the
Channel now carry their owners safely to the
Danube and the Nile; Jerusalem and the Jordan
are as common to us as were Paris and the Seine
to our grandfathers; cigar ships travelling at railway
paces will carry new Alpine members to the
mountains of Asia and South America, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shall be longing eagerly in some autumn soon to
come for news along the wires from Chimborazo,
or for tidings from the exploring party on
Dhawalagri.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the Alpine Club man
still condescends to show himself in Europe,
though his condescension is not unmixed with
a certain taint of pride. He does not carry
himself quite as another man, and has his nose
a little in the air, even when he is not climbing.
He endeavours to abstain from showing that he
despises the man who enjoys his mountains only
from the valley; but the attempt is made with too
visible an effort, and he is not quite able to bear
himself, as though he, as a genuine Alpine Club
man, were not, in some sort, a god upon the earth.
To have had his feet where our feet have never
rested, and can never rest, to have inhaled an air
rarer than that which will ever inflate our lungs, to
be one of a class permitted to face dangers which
to us would be simply suicidal, does give him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
conscious divinity of which he is, in his modesty,
not quite able to divest himself. He abstains from
mountain talk as a scholar abstains from his
grammar, or a chemist from his crucibles; but
we feel that he is abstaining because of our
ignorance; and when, at our instigation, he does
speak of mountains, we feel that he talks of them
as though they were naught, out of pity to our
incompetence.</p>

<p>There are many pursuits among us which are
of their own nature so engrossing that he who is
wedded to them cannot divorce himself from their
influences. Who does not feel that a policeman
is always a policeman, enjoying the detection of
an imaginary thief in every acquaintance with
whom he may exchange a word, and conscious of
the possibility of some delightfully-deep criminality
in the bosom of each of his dearest friends?
The very nature of the man has become impregnated
with the aptitudes of his art. How nearly
impossible it is for the actor not to be an actor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
or for a cricketer who is great in cricket to forget
his eleven, or for the billiard-player to cleanse his
mind from hazards and canons. And with all
such experts there grows up gradually an unconscious
feeling that the art in which he is skilful
is the one art worthy of a man's energy and of his
intellect. To meet a foeman worthy of his steel
he will willingly cross to the antipodes; and, as
he goes, he pities his fellow-travellers who are
cumbering themselves with the troubles of the
journey for no purpose worthy of their labour.
The genuine Alpine Club man,&mdash;he who aspires
to any distinction among his colleagues,&mdash;is
dipped as deeply in the waters of this mania as
are the policeman, and the actor, and the cricketer.
He climbs but for two months in each year of his
life, but he lives his life in those two months.
As the days of his thraldom to the ordinary duties
of life come to an end,&mdash;the days in which he is
merely a clergyman in his parish, or a lawyer
among his clients, or a clerk at his desk,&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
heart grows light and his nostrils almost expand
with the expectation of the longed-for mountain
air. Then, if you know nothing of mountain-climbing
you are nothing to him,&mdash;simply nothing.
If you are incapable of his exercise you are an
unfortunate one, to whom God has not vouchsafed
the best gift of physical life; or if you are
neglectful, you are as the prodigal son who wasted
all his substance. You eat and drink that you
may enjoy it, sacrificing for your sensual pleasures
muscles that might have made you respectable
among climbers, while he,&mdash;he eats and drinks
solely with reference to the endurance of his limbs
and the capacity of his lungs. Knowing all that
he abandons and that you enjoy, how should he
not become a Pharisee in his vocation, thanking
God that he is not as other men are?</p>

<p>But there is very much to be said in favour of
this vocation. The hero of the Alpine Club, when
at his work, is always a happy man. When he is
defeated, his defeat is only an assurance of future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
enterprise, and when he is victorious his triumph
knows no alloy. There is nothing ignoble or
sordid in his work. He requires no money reward
to instigate him to excellence, as do those who
deal in racehorses and run for prizes. His Ascot
Cup is a fragment of rock from some pointed peak,
his Derby is the glory of having stood where man
never stood before him. The occupation which he
loves has in it nothing of meanness; it is never
tainted with lucre; nor does his secret joy come
from the sorrow of another. What father wishes
his son to be great as a billiard-player? What
father does not fear to see his son too great,
even as a cricketer, or on the river? But the
Alpine Club entails no such fears. The work is
all pure,&mdash;pure in its early practice and pure in its
later triumphs. Its contact is with nature in her
grandest attire, and its associations are with forms
that are as suggestive of poetry to the intellect
as they are full of beauty for the senses.</p>

TRAVELS.</a></h2>


<hr class="r5" />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="smcap">
After</span> all it should be our first object in our
autumn tourings to like the business that we
have in hand. In all that we do, whether of
work or play, this should be a great object
with us, seeing that the comfort or discomfort&mdash;we
may almost say the happiness or unhappiness&mdash;of
our life depends upon it. But one
would suppose that in these vacation rambles
of ours, made for the recreation of our health
and the delectation of our spirits, there would
be no doubt on this head,&mdash;no doubt as to our
taking due care that our amusement should be
to our own liking, and that we so journeyed as
to be able to enjoy our journeyings. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is reason to fear that such enjoyment does not
always result from the efforts made. We see,
alas, too many of our countrymen struggling
through the severe weeks of their annual holiday
with much of the agony but with little of the
patience of martyrs. We see them thwarted at
every turn and cross because they are thwarted.
We see them toiling as no money-reward would
induce them to toil at home, and toiling with
very little of that reward for which they are
looking. We see them hot and dusty, ill at
ease, out of their element, bored almost past
their powers of endurance, so weary with work
as to drag along their unhappy limbs in actual
suffering, dreading what is to come, and looking
back upon what they have accomplished as though
to have done the thing, to have got their tour
over and finished, was the only gratification of
which they were susceptible. And with many
tourists this final accomplishment of the imposed
task is the only gratification which the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
affords. To have been over the railroads of
the Continent, to have touched at some of those
towns whose names are known so widely, to
have been told that such a summit was called by
one name and such another summit by another
name, to have crossed the mountains and heard
the whistle of a steamer on an Italian lake,&mdash;to
have done these things so that the past accomplishment
of them may be garnered like a treasure,
is very well;&mdash;but oh and alas, the doing
of them!&mdash;the troubles, the cares, the doubts,
the fears! Is it not almost a question whether
it would not be better to live at home quietly
and unambitiously, without the garnering of any
treasure which cannot be garnered without so
much discomfort and difficulty? But yet the
tourists go. Though the difficulties are great,
their ambition is greater. It does not do to
confess that you have not seen an Alp or drunk
German beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>So much may be taken for granted. Whether
we are capable of enjoying it or not, the tour
has to be made. In all probability many tours
have been made. Those who can be allowed
to enjoy themselves quietly at home, or eat
shrimps through their holiday pleasantly at
Ramsgate, are becoming from year to year, not
fewer in number, but lower down in the social
scale: so that this imperative duty of travelling
abroad,&mdash;and of doing so year after year,&mdash;becomes
much extended, and embraces all of us
who are considered anybody by those around
us. Our wives feel that they owe it to ourselves
to enforce from us the performance of
so manifest a duty, even when from tenderness
of heart they would fain spare us. And we,
who are their husbands, cannot deny them when
they put before us so plain a truth. Men there
are bold enough to stay from church on Sundays,
to dine at their clubs without leave, to light
cigars in their own parlours, and to insist upon
brandy-and-water before they go to bed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
where is the man who can tell his wife and
daughters that it is quite unnecessary that they
should go up the Rhine?</p>

<p>If this be so,&mdash;if the necessity for going be
so great, and the power of enjoying the journey
be so rare, it must be worth our while to inquire
into the matter, with the object of seeing whether
the evil may not be in some degree remedied.
The necessity which presses upon the tourist is
granted; but there may be a question whether
the misery of those who suffer cannot be remedied.
If we examine the travelling practices
of those who do suffer, and see why it is that
they do not enjoy their work, we may perhaps
get a lesson that shall be serviceable to us.</p>

<p>The great trouble of those who travel and do
not like it,&mdash;the overpowering parent grief,&mdash;is
in the language. The unfortunate tourist cannot
speak to those among whom he is going. This
simply, without the composite additions to the
fact which come to him from the state of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
own mind upon the subject, would be a misfortune,&mdash;a
want to be lamented. But the simple
misfortune is light, indeed, in comparison with
that to which it is increased by those composite
additions of his own fabrication. The
tourist in question can speak no word of German
or Italian, but unfortunately he can speak
a word or two of French, and hence comes all
his trouble. Not to speak German or Italian
is not disgraceful, but to be ignorant of French
is, in his eyes, a disgrace. Shall he make his
attempts and save himself by his little learning?
or shall he remain mute and thus suggest the
possibility of positive knowledge? Doubting between
the two he vacillates, and can obtain neither
the comparative safety of absolute dependence,
nor the substantial power of responsible action.
For the first fortnight he stumbles along with
his broken words, making what effort is in his
power; but it seems to himself that from day
to day the phrases become more difficult rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
than easier, and at last he gives himself up into
the hands of some more advanced linguist, revenging
himself upon his friends by a solemn
and enduring melancholy, as though he were
telling every one around him that, in spite of
his incapacity to speak French, he had something
within him surpassing show.</p>

<p>That this man is making a great mistake is
certain enough, but it is a mistake to which he
is driven by erroneous public utterances on the
subject. It is not true, in fact, that he is in
any way disgraced by his ignorance of French;
but it is true that he has so been told by those
who write and those who talk upon the matter.
To speak French well is a great advantage and
a charming grace. Not to speak it at all is a
great disadvantage, but it is no disgrace.
Circumstances with many have not given them
opportunity of learning the language; and others
have no aptitude for acquiring a foreign tongue.
There is no disgrace in this. But there is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
deep disgrace in the consciousness of deceit on
the subject,&mdash;in the self-knowledge possessed by
the unfortunate one that he desires to be supposed
capable of doing that which he cannot do. It is
from this that he becomes sore; and how terribly
common are the instances of such soreness!</p>

<p>From year to year we see in our guide-books
and volumes of travel the silly boastings which
drive silly men and women into this difficulty.
Those who inform us how we should travel continually
speak to us as though German and Italian
were known to most of us, and talking French was
as common with us as eating and drinking. But
to talk French well is not common to Englishmen;
it is in truth a rare accomplishment. And then
these informants, armed, let us hope, with true
knowledge on their own parts, jeer most unmercifully
at us poor tourists who venture to come abroad in
our ignorance. We are ridiculed for our dumbness
if we are dumb, and for our efforts at speech
if we attempt to speak. And then we are talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at, rather than addressed. The accomplished
informant who intends to guide us speaks always
to some brother as accomplished as himself, and
warns this learned brother against the ignorance
of the masses. It is not very long since a
distinguished contributor to a very distinguished
newspaper advised his readers that an Englishman
at Rome should never know another Englishman
there; and this warning of Britons against other
Britons on the Continent is so common that it
has reached us all. It means nothing; or, at
any rate, should be taken as meaning nothing.
Not one amongst twenty of English men or
English women who travel, can travel, or should
attempt to travel, after the fashion which is
intended to be prescribed by these counsellors.
A few among us may so live abroad as
to become conversant with the inner life of the
people with whom they are dwelling,&mdash;to know
their houses, their sons and their daughters; to
see their habits, to talk with them, eat with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and quarrel with them; but to do this is not and
should not be the object of the vacation tourist;
and if the vacation tourist cannot save himself
from being made miserable by his guide-books
and pretentious informants, because he is unable
to do that which he never should have regarded as
being within his power, he had certainly better
remain at home.</p>

<p>To wander along the shores of lakes, to climb
up mountains, to visit cities, to see pictures, and
stand amidst the architecture of the old or of
the new world, is very good, even though the man
who does these things can speak no word out of his
own language. To speak another language well
is very good also, and to speak another language
badly is much better than not to speak it at all.
All that is required is that there should be no
humbug, no pretence, no insincerity, either as
regards self or others. Let him whose foreign
vocabulary is very limited use it boldly as far as
it will go; and let him acknowledge to himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that he is going to see the outside of things, and
not the inside. It is not given to any of us to
see the inside of many things. Why be discomforted
because you cannot learn the mysteries
of Italian life, seeing that in all probability you
know nothing of the inner life of the man who
lives next door to you at home? There is a
whole world close to you which you have not
inspected. What do you know of the thoughts
and feelings of those who inhabit your own
kitchen? But in seeing the outer world, which
is open to your eye, there may be great joy,
almost happiness,&mdash;if you will only look at it
with sincerity.</p>

<p>There is another grievance, cognate with this
grievance of language, which much troubles some
tourists,&mdash;a grievance which indeed springs altogether
from that lack of language. The money
of these unlearned ones will not go so far with
them as it would do if they could do their bargaining
in French with a fluent tongue. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
imperious guide-books have not failed to throw
into the teeth of monolingual travellers their
disadvantages in this respect, and to do all that
lay in their power to add a further heavy misery
on this head to the other miseries of tourists.
No doubt my friend the Italian innkeeper would
be more easily pressible&mdash;what we generally call
more reasonable&mdash;in his financial arrangements
if you could argue out the question of your bed and
supper in good Tuscan; but in this matter, as in
all others, you must pay for that which you have
not got, and cut your coat according to your cloth.
Are you going to be miserable because you, who
have to pay your railway fares, cannot travel as
cheaply as your friend who has a free ticket wherever
he goes? A free ticket is a nice thing; but
not having one, you must pay your fare.</p>

<p>But there are other sources of unhappiness,
independent of those arising from language, which
go far towards robbing the English tourist of the
pleasure he has anticipated. He always attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to do too much, and in his calculations as to space
and time forgets that his body is human and that
his powers of endurance are limited. With his
Bradshaw in his hand and his map before him, he
ignores the need of rest, and lays out for himself
a scheme of travelling in which there is no leisure,
no repose, no acknowledgment on his own part
that even sleep is necessary for him. To do all
that can be done for the money is the one great
object which he has ever in view; to visit as many
cities as may possibly be visited in the time, to have
run the length of as many railways as can be
brought within the compass of his short six weeks,
to tick off the different places one after another on
his list, as though it were a duty imperative upon
him to see them all, and having seen them, to
hurry on to new scenes,&mdash;this is his plan of action,
and with such a plan of action is it possible that
he should like his work? Must it not be a
certain result of such travelling that the traveller
will have but one source of comfort during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
journey, and that that will spring from the blessed
remembrance that his labours will have an
end?</p>

<p>If I may venture to give two words of advice
to those of my fellow-countrymen who travel frequently
during their vacations, and who feel on
self-examination that they have not hitherto in
reality liked their tourings, in those two words I
will advise them both to affect less and to perform
less. What matters it who knows that you
cannot speak two words of French together
grammatically? All whom it in the least concerns
probably do know it. Be content to speak your
two words ungrammatically, or, if that be beyond
you, be content not to speak them at all. The
mountains and valleys will render themselves to
you without French. The pictures on the walls
will not twit you with your ignorance. Venus
and Apollo could not come to you out of their
marble, though they were as many-tongued as
Mezzofanti; but they will come to you if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
speak to them out of your own heart with such
language as is at your ready disposal. But, above
all things, take your time in discoursing with
these works of nature and these works of art.
To be able to be happy and at rest among the
mountains is better than a capacity for talking
French in saloons.</p>
